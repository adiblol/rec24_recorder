rec24 - continuous, gapless audio recorder

Highlights:
 * records from soundcard or other audio application, using ALSA or JACK
 * writes to unlimited (actually, limited by CPU and RAM) number of formats concurrently
 * starts new file every given time, for example 1 hour
 * automatically sets priorities to avoid dropouts even if you're compiling something on the same machine ;)
 * modular architecture, allows you to specify custom recording method and storage formats

Requirements:
 * Bash
 * MySQL database for index (it is used by rec24_player)
 * mysql command line client
 * sox when using ALSA, or jack_capture when using JACK
 * mbuffer
 * nice, ionice, chrt
 * flac and metaflac for FLAC, oggenc and oggtag for Ogg/Vorbis
 * recommended: system tuned for realtime audio! lowlatency/realtime kernel, disabled swap etc...
 * at least basic experience in Linux audio. Maybe some day there will be tutorial for newbies...

Installation:
 * Create database (schema is in file initial_schema.sql) and database user.
 * Import initial_data.sql, it contains example data
 * mv store.d.example store.d
 * Customize files in store.d to change formats
 * mv config.sh.example config.sh
 * Customize config.sh
 * mv my.cnf.example my.cnf
 * Change database name, user and password in my.cnf
 * ./rec24 record config.sh

Happy hacking!
